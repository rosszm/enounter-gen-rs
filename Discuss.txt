Since I had a complete implementation of ex4, most of my work for this exercise
was refactoring what I a previously written. The first major modification I did
was getting rid of uses of "lambda-dispatch" within my monster iterator. I did
this by creating two separate iterator structs, one that allows repeats and one
that doesn't. I then created two functions within the Monsters struct that
return the respective iterator. I also moved the iterators into their own iter 
sub-module.

The next major change I made was creating separate binaries for each task. In 
ex4 I had already separated the different tasks into their own functions, so
this change was fairly simple to perform. However, It did involve taking a look
at my project structure.

Lastly, I modified my Encounter struct to use the method suggested in our 
Wednesday meetings, the method of added them all to the vector, sorting, then
counting multiple occurrences. In ex4 I had used a indexmap to map monsters to
their usage. I decided to implement this new method because I wanted the 
experience of implementing multiple different methods. This vector method has a 
sightly lower time cost for insertion and a smaller space cost when there is a 
small number of repetitions. However, because the same monster is only represented
once using the indexmap method, it is likely to be more efficient when there is 
a large number of repeated monsters in the encounter.
